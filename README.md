CarrotOmics_chado_search
========================

This is the customization of the chado_search module used on the CarrotOmics.org site.

This repository does not contain the entire module, only the customized files
located in `chado_search/includes/search/carrotomics/`
and the configuration file `chado_search/file/carrotomics.conf`

It is a work-in-progress, and not ready for general use.
