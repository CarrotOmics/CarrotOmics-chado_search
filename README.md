CarrotOmics_chado_search
========================

This is the customization of the chado_search module used on the CarrotOmics.org site.

This repository does not contain the entire module, only the customized files
located in `chado_search/includes/search/carrotomics/`
and in `chado_search/includes/mview/carrotomics/`
and the configuration file `chado_search/file/carrotomics.conf`

It is a work-in-progress, and not ready for general use.

One enhancement of searches is support for infraspecific nomenclature, for example
![Germplasm Search by Name example image](/docs/germplasm-search-by-name-example.png?raw=true "Example of Germplasm Search by Name page")

Image search allows filtering by year.
